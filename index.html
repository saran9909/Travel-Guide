            <h5>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj <br>Mahal?</h5>
            <div class="para-1">
                <p>Quite honestly, we can't think of one.</p>

                <p>At the very least, there's no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than <br>building a marble masterpiece for one's favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br> its magnificence up close.</p>
                
                <p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <span class="highlight">India</span>  between 1631 and 1648, it's also history. And, of course, it's <br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br> Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p>
                
                <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br> and so much more…</p>
            </div>
            

        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.

            <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian <br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you. <br>
                
            <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <span class="highlight">8-day Golden Triangle tours</span>  (now with <span class="highlight">solo-only <br> departures</span>!)  to <span class="highlight">15-day trips dedicated to food</span> , to 19-day trips combining the <span class="highlight">highlights of India <br> and Nepal</span> . </p>
                
            <p>you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from <br> Delhi. Check out <span class="highlight-1">Urban Adventures</span> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while <br> you’re at it, check out their day trips in <span class="highlight">Delhi,Jaipur</span>, <span class="highlight-1">Varanasi</span> and <span class="highlight-1">Mumbai</span> !</p>

             alt="pic-3" height="50%"; width="50%";>    
            <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally <br> prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>  
            <h4>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p>

            <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Passport</li><br>
                <li>Money</li><br>
                <li>Water</li><br>
                <li>Medicine</li><br>
                <li>Camera</li><br>
                <li>Phone</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h4>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br> need to cover your head, shoulders, and knees.</p>
            <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear <br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p>
            <p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br> the worst of the heat.</p>

             alt="pic-4" height="50%" width="50%">
            <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>
            <div class="double-quote">
                <p><span class="double-quote-1">''</span> <br> Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are <br> easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are <br> to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of <br> laces are hard!</p></div>        
            <h4>Other things you need to know</h4>
            <p>No food is allowed inside.</p>
            <p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</p>
            <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. <br> Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small <br> video cameras) are not allowed.</p>
            <p>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your <br> wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p>
            <h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br> possible).</p>
            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg"
             alt="Taj_mahal" height="50%" width="50%">
            <p>If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an <br> amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to <br> take you there and back cheaply.)

            <p>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br> (or more!) remain in awe of it. <span class="highlight">Sana Jinah</span> , one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has <br> some tips on how to do this:</p>
            <div class="double-quote">
                <p><span class="double-quote-1">"</span>The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m <br> done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to <br> make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then <br> they will no longer be surprises! <br>
                    The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the <br> sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</p>
            </div>
            <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise on a clear day.</p>
            <h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br> on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p>
            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg"
             alt="pic-5" height="50%" width="50%">
            <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth <br> seeking out.</p>
            <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span class="highlight">Pravin <br> Tamang</span>. (His photography is amazing – check it out!)</p>
            <ul type="square">
                    <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li><br>
                    <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main <br> platform</li><br>
                    <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li><br>
                    <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li><br>
                    <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br> Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the <br> day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p>

            <h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br> explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
            <h4>What to do in Agra</h4>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is <br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p>
            <p>Despite being located on the <span class="highlight">Golden Triangle</span>  tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in <br> many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br> likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</p>
            <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br> (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe <br> run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their <br> stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p>

            <h4>Where to go outside of Agra</h4>
            <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, <br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p>
            <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br> and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit <br> it on <span class="highlight">this 15-day trip</span> from <span class="highlight">Delhi to Kathmandu</span>  (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p>
            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg"
             alt="pic-7" height="50%" width="50%">
             <div class="para-2">
                <p>Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p>
             </div>
            <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <span class="highlight">‘Pink City’</span>, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br> chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting <br> bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</p>
            <p>Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home <br> to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy <br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this 15-day trip all around <br> Rajasthan.</p>
            <h2>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h2>
            <p>As you may have <span class="highlight">read</span> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br> clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.</p>
            <p>Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br> surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br> applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried <br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br> carried out on the historic site.</p>
